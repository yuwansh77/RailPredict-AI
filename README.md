# Train Delay Prediction System 🚆

This project is a machine learning-based system designed to predict train arrival delays. It uses historical train data, including journey details, operational parameters, and weather conditions, to accurately forecast expected delays, thereby assisting in operational optimization and improving passenger experience.

## Features

- **Data Processing & Training:** A robust data pipeline that handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and engineers time-based features from raw dataset information.
- **Machine Learning Model:** A Random Forest Regressor trained to predict `Arrival_Delay_min`.
- **Interactive Web UI:** A user-friendly Streamlit application that allows users to input current or planned journey details and instantly receive a predicted delay.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** A Jupyter Notebook detailing the data analysis, feature importance, and model selection steps.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application for the interactive web frontend.
- `train_model.py`: The training script. It loads the dataset, preprocesses the features, trains the Random Forest model, and saves the artifacts for inference.
- `predict.py`: An alternative script containing logic for predictions.
- `Train_Delay_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing detailed exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.
- `stratquest_dataset.csv`: The dataset used to train the machine learning model.
- `train_delay_model_artifacts.pkl`: The serialized model and preprocessing artifacts (scikit-learn Imputers, LabelEncoders, etc.) generated by `train_model.py`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need Python installed on your system. The project relies on several key packages:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `streamlit`
- `scikit-learn`
- `joblib`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy streamlit scikit-learn joblib
```

### 1. Train the Model

Before running the web application, you must generate the model artifacts. This is done by running the training script against the provided dataset (`stratquest_dataset.csv`):

```bash
python train_model.py
```
*Note: This script will output model performance metrics (MAE, RMSE, R2 Score) to the terminal and create the `train_delay_model_artifacts.pkl` file.*

### 2. Run the Application

Once the model is trained and the artifacts file exists, you can start the Streamlit web application:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch a local web server (typically at `http://localhost:8501`) where you can interact with the Train Delay Predictor.

## Usage Guide (Streamlit App)
1. **Journey Details:** Enter the distance, scheduled travel date/time, expected travel time, number of stops, and any previous delays.
2. **Operational & Weather:** Set the current operational statuses (Locomotive type, passenger load, signal failures/maintenance flags) and forecast weather conditions.
3. **Predict:** Click "Predict Arrival Delay" to get the estimated delay time. The app will warn you if a significant delay (>15 minutes) is expected.
